 Hi, Iâ€™m Amber! ðŸ‘‹

I have just completed my Integrated Master's degree in Biomedical Sciences at Cardiff University achieveing a first class and I  am soon to be a PhD student at the University of Bristol, joining the AI for Collective Intelligence Hub  
within the Pandemic Resilience theme. My research will focus on developing AI methods for infectious  
disease outbreaks and pandemics.


My research interests include infectious disease epidemiology, theoretical  biology, and the  
application of mathematics to real-world problems.
