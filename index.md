title: About me 🧪🧬🌱
---

 Hi, I’m Amber! I have just completed my Integrated Master's degree in Biomedical Sciences at Cardiff University. I am soon to be a PhD student at the University
 of Bristol where I will be joining the AI for collective intelligence hub, working within the Pandemic Resilience theme. My research will focus on developing
 AI methods for infectious disease outbreaks and pandemics.

  My research interests include infectious disease epidemiology, systems biology and the application of mathematics to real-world problems.
