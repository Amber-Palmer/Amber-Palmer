  ## Hi, I’m Amber! 👋

  I have just completed my Integrated Master's degree in **Biomedical Sciences** at Cardiff University.  
  I am soon to be a **PhD student** at the University of Bristol, joining the **AI for Collective Intelligence Hub**  
  within the *Pandemic Resilience* theme. My research will focus on developing AI methods for infectious  
  disease outbreaks and pandemics.

  My research interests include **infectious disease epidemiology**, **systems biology**, and the  
  application of **mathematics to real-world problems**.
